<p>The Boston Symmetry Group organizes events for Boston-area researchers that are interested in the interplay between symmetries and machine learning. Relevant research topics include invariant/equivariant neural networks, symmetries in learning algorithms, graph neural networks, and applications of symmetries in machine learning for physical systems, molecules, and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="boston-symmetry-day">Boston Symmetry Day</h2>
<p>Boston Symmetry Day is a biannual meeting of symmetry-minded folks in the Boston area. It is open to registration for all who would like to attend, subject to space constraints. Registration is free, but we cannot provide travel funding at this time.</p>
